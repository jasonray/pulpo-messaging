    title: "statman-stopwatch"
    excerpt: "I have spent a ton time in my career tracking performance metrics.  I created a suite of metrics under the name `statman`, inspired by [Coda Hale's Dropwizard](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/) project.  `statman-stopwatch` is a simple high res stopwatch for node.js applications. The Stopwatch is useful for determining the amount of time it takes to perform an activity."
